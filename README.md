# Birthday-Tracker
A simple python program to keep track of birthdays.

## Getting Started
To use this program, simply run it in your terminal or command prompt and follow the on-screen instructions.
## Usage
To run the program, simply execute the script using a Python interpreter. The program will prompt the user to enter a name and will respond based on whether the name exists in the dictionary or not. If the name exists, it will retrieve the birthday. If it does not exist, it will ask for the birthday and add the new name-birthday pair to the dictionary. The program will repeat this process until the user enters a blank name, after which it will exit.

## Requirements
Python3 installed on the system.
## Changes
Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs and requirements. The dictionary birthdays can be pre-populated with initial values, and the program logic can be extended to include additional features.
## Overview
The program stores a dictionary of birthdays with names as keys and birthdates as values. When the program is run, the user is prompted to enter a name. If the name is found in the dictionary, the corresponding birthday is displayed. If the name is not found, the user is prompted to input the birthday, and the information is added to the dictionary. This process repeats until the user inputs a blank name, at which point the program exits.

## Conclusion
The Birthday Tracker code allows the user to input a name and retrieve or add the corresponding birthday to the database stored in a dictionary. The program will continue to run until the user enters a blank name, at which point the program will exit. The code demonstrates the use of dictionaries and loops in Python.
